Install splunklib into this folder -> [splunklib](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python)

git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python.git

then move splunklib back into lib, ie you should have itsi_toolbox/lib/splunklib

Last tested with 1.7.4

or execute the get_splunklib.sh in itsi_toolbox/lib
